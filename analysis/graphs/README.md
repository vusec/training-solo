# Graphs

This folder contains all scripts to generate the graphs based on the
results.

To generate all graphs, execute `create_all.sh` with the parent folder
of the results as an argument (e.g., _parent_/linux6.8.0-38-generic/).

```bash
./create_all.sh ~/Downloads
```

All results are available in the repository release.
